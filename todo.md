TO DO
=============

+ ~~admin page~~
+ ~~upload location setting~~ -upload to wherever you want
+ ~~upload a file~~ -multiple files, no need for folder
+ ~~upload a folder~~
+ ~~download a file~~
+ ~~download a folder~~
+ ~~mkdir~~
+ ~~playlist~~
+ stream as .ogg for firefox.
+ ~~if admin- allow delete song~~
+ ~~if admin- allow delete folder~~
+ ~~hide all unknown file types from dir listing and search results.~~
+ search full file path vs filename only as an option set in admin!
+ make sure the file deleted is underneath the LIB_DIR folder. To be safe.



#Strange bug:

When the cron job runs I get unicode errors in the search results on the server. However if I start the run.sh script from the command line it works fine.
